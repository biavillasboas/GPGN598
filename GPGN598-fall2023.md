## Course-Specific Details and Policies

### Course Description:
This course provides an introduction to the field of physical oceanography. The material will center primarily on the ocean's interaction with the atmosphere and other aspects of the ocean that influence the Earth's climate. We will cover the major elements of physical oceanography, including the fundamentals of the global ocean circulation and the mechanisms that drive it. To achieve this, we will use a combination of lectures, hands-on laboratory experiments, and data exploration. This course will offer you an opportunity to apply skills from traditional areas of STEM to problems that focus on the Earth system and explore the ocean's role in influencing our changing climate. The main objectives of this course are to:

-   **Develop** awareness of the role of the ocean in the global climate system.
-   **Describe** the major patterns of ocean circulation and how they affect the distribution of tracers (for example, heat, salt, nutrients, carbon) through the world's oceans.
-   **Apply** curiosity, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills to **analyze** laboratory experiments and oceanographic data and **relate** the observations to ocean physics.
-   **Discuss** some of the major current topics in the field of physical oceanography, including research based on theory, numerical modeling, and observations.

This course will be highly collaborative and applied. After completing the course, students can expect to be familiar with how we observe the ocean, where to find oceanography data, and how to use these data to understand the ocean's role in major challenges facing our society, such as global warming and extreme weather events.

I will also point you to scientific papers related to topics we will cover in class, so you can dig deeper into topics that interest you.

### 💻 Required Technology:
- Laptop (Mac, Linux, or Windows) and access to Google Colab (more details to follow). Please come talk to me as soon as possible if you need help finding a laptop that you can use for the course.
- Web-access
- Canvas 

### 📢 Course Communication:
Canvas will serve as our official home for communication for this course. Course announcements, resources, and as discussion boards will be posted on the GPGN 498/598 Canvas page. 

You should not hesitate to seek help, and can do this in the following ways:
1.  Ask questions in class. Never hesitate to ask, even if I have explained the material before. You can safely assume that if something is not clear to you, there are several classmates that have the same question. I can also answer questions related to projects/assignments during class.
2.  Seek the help of the teaching assistant.
3. Drop by my office. On the first day of class, we will decide on a time slot for drop-in office hours. During that time, you are welcome to come by my office without an appointment. Outside of drop-in hours, you may [schedule an appointment with me](https://outlook.office.com/bookwithme/user/12dfdf8a370d4da38883619eb1ea9ff0@mines.edu/meetingtype/JUmkbWPPbkixcrTpaJnWBg2?anonymous&ep=mCardFromTile).

As an assistant professor at Mines, I have many other responsibilities in addition to teaching. I ask that you be respectful of my time. I only check my email twice a day (I don't mean emails from students, I mean *all* emails). This means that you can expect a one-day response turnaround during the week, but it might take several hours until you hear back from me. I don't check emails on weekends and holidays.

4.  Please only use email to clarify simple questions. I will not provide extensive feedback on assignments or questions about class material through email (but would be happy to arrange a meeting time). If anything is not clear, or if you need help with anything, please ask in a timely way using any of the options above. ⚠⚠ Please include **GPGN498** or **GPGN598** in the subject line of any email that you send to me. 


### 🧮 Grading Policy:
My role as a teacher is to support you and provide a nurturing environment that focuses on your learning. Unfortunately, we are still in a system that requires that I assign you grades. Below is what will form the basis of your final grades. The goal is for this to reflect our success in achieving the learning outcomes of this class. 

- **Class Engagement (10%).**  The success of our class will hinge on active engagement from everyone in the classroom. During lectures, guest lectures, discussions, and active learning exercises, this entails coming to class having completed the assigned tasks, being engaged, asking questions, participating in exercises and demonstrations, and promoting class interaction. Outside of the classroom, this entails actively participating in Canvas discussions, in the form of questions, comments, answers, and feedback. This is a holistic grade based on your conduct throughout the term. If you are worried or concerned about your class participation, I am happy to provide feedback throughout the semester.

- **Quizzes (20%  ).** Throughout the semester I will distribute short unannounced in-class quizzes. This will consist of one question to be answered in 10-15 min **at the beginning of the class period**. Quizzes can cover any material up-to-date, but most likely will focus on relatively recent material. The goal of the quizzes are two fold: (i) help me adjust the pace of the course; (ii) To assemble meaningful statistics of your understanding of the material. 

- **Assignments (40%).** There will be two types of assignments: 📝 problem sets and 🧪 lab worksheets. Problem sets will make up the bulk of your homework. There will be four problem sets due at approximately 3 week intervals. These will involve a mix of theoretical problems and data analysis on Google Colab. Problem sets will be long, so start early! We will occasionally have lab demos during class. During each lab you will  complete a lab worksheet which will also count towards your assignments grade. You may discuss the assignments with fellow students but you need to complete the assignment yourself. Students enrolled at the 598 level will have additional questions to complete.

- **Final Project (30%).** The course will culminate with a final project. The project and expectations will be different for 498 and 598 students. 
	- **GPGN 498**:  Your final project will consist of a conference poster to be presented to the public during our Oceanography Fair in the last week of classes. You will work in groups of 2-3 for your final projects to showcase an observational tool and its application. We will discuss the details of the final project in class.
	- **GPGN 598**: Your final project will consist of a ~10 page term paper and a lightning talk at the end of the term during our Oceanography Fair. You project will cover background, methods and data analysis of an oceanography problem that you find interesting – I will work with you on choosing a topic. In addition to your final project, you will be asked to be a poster judge during the 498 student posters.  We will discuss the details of the final project in class.

The numeric-to-letter grade scale is shown below:

| **Range** | **Letter Grade** | **Range** | **Letter Grade** |
| --------- | ---------------- | --------- | ---------------- |
| >= 93.0   | A                | 73.0–76.9 | C                |
| 90.0–92.9 | A-               | 70.0–72.9 | C-               |

| 83.0–86.9 | B                | 63.0-66.9 | D                |
| 80.0–82.9 | B-               | 60.0–62.9 | D-               |
| 77.0–79.9 | C+               | <60       | F                |


### ⏰ Late work
There are many items in this class that need to be handed in. In order to keep everything on schedule, I would like you to be sure to hand in assignments on time. If you anticipate difficulty completing an assignment on time, please contact me as early as possible to make arrangements. You will have a grace period of 24h after the due date to submit your work with a 10% penalization. Assignments will not be accepted after 24h . My goal is that you succeed in this class, so If you're struggling to complete your assignments in time, please come talk to me.

### 🤖 Generative Artificial Intelligence:

The Office of the Provost encourages the entire University community to explore the uses and impacts of GenAI technologies, whether through critical discussions or creative applications. Based on a review of the most recent [Guidelines for Using Generative Artificial Intelligence at Colorado School of Mines](https://www.mines.edu/academic-affairs/genai), the GenAI policy for this course will be *adapted* from the campus **general permission** as follows:

Generative Artificial Intelligence (genAI) tools such as ChatGPT are important resources in many fields and industries. Because these tools will be used in professional and personal contexts, I believe it is valuable for you to engage critically with these tools and explore their use in generating content that helps your learning.

You may use genAI tools to help generate ideas and brainstorm. However, you should note that the material generated by these tools may be inaccurate, incomplete, biased, or otherwise problematic. I encourage you to consider how genAI complements, supplants, or fails to replace your contributions and abilities. **I discourage you from submitting material for evaluation that has been generated using genAI.** 

If you include content (e.g., ideas, text, code, images) that was generated, in whole or in part, by Generative Artificial Intelligence tools (including, but not limited to, ChatGPT and other large language models) in work submitted for evaluation in this course, [you must document and credit your source](https://libguides.mines.edu/citing/AI) as well as document the steps used to produce the content (i.e., screenshots of your prompts and chat) Failure to properly cite sources, including AI tools for generating content, would be considered Academic Misconduct in violation of [Mines Academic Integrity/Misconduct Policy](https://www.mines.edu/policy-library/academic-integrity-policy/).

As your instructor, I may request that you walk me through your thought process and explain your answer orally at any time I deem necessary.   

### Diversity and Inclusion:
At Colorado School of Mines, we understand that a diverse and inclusive learning environment inspires creativity and innovation, which are essential to the engineering process. We also know that in order to address current and emerging national and global challenges, it is important to learn with and from people who have different backgrounds, thoughts, and experiences.

Our students represent every state in the nation and more than 90 countries around the world, and we continue to make progress in the areas of diversity and inclusion by providing [Diversity and Inclusion programs and services](https://www.mines.edu/diversity/) to support these efforts.

### Discrimination, Harassment, and Title IX:
All learning opportunities at Mines, including this course, require an environment that allows each student to be able to learn without fear of discrimination or harassment based on any protected class. Mines's core values of respect, diversity, compassion, and collaboration will be honored in this course, and the standards in this class are the same as those expected in any professional work environment. (More information can be found [here](http://inside.mines.edu/UserFiles/File/FacultySenate/Documents/ValuesAndAspirationsStatement2-14-17.pdf).) Discrimination or harassment of any type will not be tolerated. As a participant in this course, we expect you to respect your instructor and your classmates. As your instructor, it is my responsibility to foster a learning environment that supports diversity of thoughts, perspectives and experiences, and honors your identities.  To help accomplish this:
- Course rosters are provided to the instructor with the student’s legal name. I will honor your request to address you by a preferred name or gender pronoun. Please advise me of this preference early in the semester so that I may make appropriate changes to my records.
- If something is said or done in this course (by anyone, including myself) that made you or others feel uncomfortable, or if your performance in the course is being impacted by your experiences outside of the course, please report it to:
	- Me (if you are comfortable doing so)  
	- [The Office of Institutional Equity & Title IX](https://www.mines.edu/institutional-equity-title-ix/reporting/)  
	- [The Office of Institutional Equity & Title IX – Anonymous Option](https://www.mines.edu/institutional-equity-title-ix/submit-report/)

In this course, we will cultivate a community that supports survivors, prevents interpersonal violence, and promotes a harassment free environment. Title IX and Colorado State law protects individuals from discrimination based on sex and gender in educational programs and activities. Mines takes this obligation seriously and is committed to providing a campus community free from gender and sex-based discrimination. Discrimination, including sexual harassment, sexual violence, dating violence, domestic violence, and stalking, is prohibited and will not be tolerated within the Mines campus community. If these issues have affected you or someone you know, you can access the appropriate resources on the [Mines Title IX website](https://www.mines.edu/title-ix/). You can also contact the Mines Title IX Coordinator, Carole Goddard, at 303.273.3260 or titleix@mines.edu for more information.

**It's on us, all of the Mines community, to engineer a culture of respect.**
